# UncannyVideoMaker

Make your own uncanny videos!

This game allows you to create your own "Mr. Incredible Becoming Uncanny" videos. It was a really basic project I made in like 2 hours as a joke but I thought it was cool. You can do just about anything to customize the video, including swapping out images, changing audio, and changing text. The zip package includes a short tutorial explaining the features and how to use them.

The source code uses Unity version 2020.3.16f1. Any other Unity version close to that should work, but I'm not sure about any others.
